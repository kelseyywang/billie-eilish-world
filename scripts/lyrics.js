    "My Lucifer is lonely  Standing there, killing time Can't commit to anything but a crime Peter's on vacation, an open invitation Animals, evidence Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence Once you get inside 'em Got friends but can't invite them  Hills burn in California My turn to ignore ya Don't say I didn't warn ya  All the good girls go to hell 'Cause even God herself has enemies And once the water starts to rise And Heaven's out of sight She'll want the Devil on her team  My Lucifer is lonely  Look at you needing me You know I'm not your friend without some greenery Walk in wearin' fetters Peter should know better Your cover up is caving in Man is such a fool, why are we saving him? Poisoning themselves now Begging for our help, wow  Hills burn in California My turn to ignore ya Don't say I didn't warn ya  All the good girls go to hell 'Cause even God herself has enemies And once the water starts to rise And Heaven's out of sight She'll want the Devil on her team  My Lucifer is lonely There's nothing left to save now My god is gonna owe me There's nothing left to save now  I cannot do the snowflake",
